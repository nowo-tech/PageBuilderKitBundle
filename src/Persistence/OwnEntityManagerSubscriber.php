/**
 * Keeps the bundle's OWN entity manager (`doctrine.entity_manager`) usable in a kept-alive kernel (1.14; outermost
 * boundaries since 1.15.1).
 *
 * Registered only when `doctrine.entity_manager` is set and is not the host's default manager: that manager maps the
 * bundle entities only, so the bundle recreates it when a failed flush closed it and clears it at every OUTERMOST
 * unit-of-work boundary, so no managed page survives into the next request, message or command (REQ-RUNTIME-002
 * rule 4). The host's managers are never reset nor cleared (rule 7: the host clears its own managers).
 *
 * Boundaries (same policy as ContactFormBundle 1.7.1 `ContactFormEntityManagerClearSubscriber`), judged by
 * {@see UnitOfWorkBoundaries}, which tracks the running units at the extreme priorities:
 * - HTTP: the main `kernel.request` (priority 4096) and `kernel.terminate` (priority -1024), only outside a console
 *   command and a Messenger message. An in-process `HttpKernel::handle()` from a command or a handler does not clear
 *   the unit that runs it; sub-requests share their main request's unit of work;
 * - Messenger: when a message is received (priority 4096) and after it is handled or failed (priority -1024);
 * - console: when the OUTERMOST command starts and terminates. A command run in-process from another command, a
 *   message handler or a controller does not clear the outer unit's manager (with `transaction: host` that would
 *   discard the host's pending changes).
 *
 * The manager arrives as an iterator of an IGNORE_ON_UNINITIALIZED_REFERENCE reference, so a boundary only touches a
 * manager the unit of work already built and never builds one itself; the registry is a plain reference.
 *
 * @internal registered by the bundle; the constructor is not a public API
